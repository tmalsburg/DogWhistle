\subsection{Project description}

% Describe the main research question, the current state of the art,
% project-related preliminary work, the work programme and
% methodology, and integration in the Collaborative Research
% Centre. The information provided in this section should be able to
% stand on its own and be understandable, coherent and reviewable
% without the need to read additional documents.

% Antje: The following structure of subsections of 3.3 is proposed in
% the template, but it is said that this subsection CAN be structured
% in this way, so it is not mandatory. The structure of all other
% sections and subsections seems to be mandatory however.

\subsubsection{Summary and main research question} % ½ page

Interlocutors design utterances such that they efficiently convey intended literal and non-literal (i.e. implied) meaning when interpreted in the context of a shared reference system.  While this may seem unsurprising and even trivial, there are also well-documented scenarios where utterances systematically fail to communicate intended meaning.  One example is gendered language where it has been observed that speakers utterances consist of male-biased language even when a gender-neutral or even female-biased  meaning was plausibly intended (e.g. the speaker refers to the future president as “he” even though a female president is likely).  Likewise, it has been shown that comprehenders’ interpretations of gender neutral expressions, can be male-biased, e.g. when a comprehender assumes a “baker” to be male even though the speaker didn’t make that explicit and even though the a baker is perceived to be male as likely as female.

% {\bf JT: not sure which 5 publications to include}

% \noindent 
% Speaker utterances index particular beliefs about the world,
% societal structures, and ideologies, but also biases and
% stereotypes...

% Code words are expressions that index particular beliefs and
% ideologies for some but, crucially, not all, language users. (other
% terms: code words, dogwhistles, multivocality) For instance, in
% German, so-called generic masculine forms like {\em B\"acker}
% `baker' [...]

% Long-term questions:

% {\bf 1.} Which expressions index beliefs for which groups of
% language users? Which meanings do they convey / which
% connotations/ideologies do they index?

% {\bf 2.} Which linguistic and extralinguistic properties taxonomize
% these expressions? Which meanings/connotations/ideologies are
% conventionally coded, which ones arise from interlocutor
% beliefs/biases/stereotypes?

% {\bf 3.} What does a predictive analysis of these expressions look
% like? How can such an analysis be validated in large, unconstrained
% datasets?

% {\bf Questions to be addressed in phase 1:}

% - German expressions around the topics of gender

% code words/dogwhistle: {\em Tante, Tussi}

% gendered nouns (generic masculine nouns, inclusive forms with `Binnen-I', *, :)

% - Methods: annotation of naturally occurring examples
% (Bundestagscorpus, newspapers), experiments to diagnose properties
% of the content, social perception, language comprehension, and
% language processing

% - Computational modelling

% - Project is also concerned with challenges to successful
% communication, signaling persona and ideology, signaling intended
% action and in/out-group building

% - written or spoken language, or both?

State of the art is very theoretical, but empirical situation is impoverished (slurs, dogwhistles, code words)

\subsubsection{Work programme and role within the proposed Collaborative Research Centre} % ¾ page

\noindent
In the first phase, we focus on the social meaning of irony in questions. {\bf WP 1:} We empirically investigate the social meanings of ironic questions through a combination of methods. {\bf WP 2:} Literary and linguistic perspectives on reference systems involved in irony, social meaning, and the social meaning of irony will be integrated. {\bf WP 3:} Building on our findings from WPs 1 and 2, we will develop a predictive model of the social meanings of irony in questions.

By investigating the social meanings of irony as a literary and linguistic phenomenon, the project considers cognitive, social and aesthetic perspectives on reference systems. Because multiple reference systems need to be considered, our project contributes to the understanding of the interconnection and transformation of reference systems. Our empirical work will lay the foundation for exploring Machine Learning techniques in future phases of the CRC. We also plan to collaborate closely with projects that investigate figurative language and work with naturally occurring corpora.
