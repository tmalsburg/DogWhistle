A03: DoWi -- Dog whistles, plausible deniability, and persuation in German and English political speech

This project investigates dog whistles in German and English, that is expressions that encode an overt benign literal meaning while also carrying a controversial subtext.  A much-cited example from the US American context is {\em inner city crime}, which may carry racist overtones by implying crime committed by African Americans.  Pilot studies by the co-PIs suggest that the expression {\em Hilfe vor Ort} `local assistance' may be a dog whistle in the German context, implying that the country should work towards keeping people affected by war out of Germany.

To date, research on dog whistles has largely been limited to American English and the US American context.  Linguistic research on the meaning and use of American dog whistles has resulted in theoretical proposals that differ in the theoretical status ascribed to dog whistle content as well as its predicted interaction with interlocutors' beliefs about the world and each other.  Complementing the linguistic research, experiment-based research in the social and political sciences suggests that the perception of dog whistle content varies by social group. 

This project investigates dog whistles in German and English, with the goal of developing an as yet missing taxonomy of dog whistle content based on linguistically-informed empirical investigations, as well as a predictive analysis of such content.  Given the interdisciplinary nature of this investigation, this project will greatly benefit from regular interactions with social and political scientists in the CRC.  As the interpretation of dog whistles varies by social group, our project contributes to the overarching question of how reference systems interconnect in utterance interpretation, and how they are transformed.
